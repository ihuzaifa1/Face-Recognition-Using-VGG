# Face-Recognition-Using-VGG
I developed a Face Recognition Attendance System using the VGGFace model for facial recognition. This system captures real-time video input, detects faces, and accurately recognizes individuals by comparing their facial embeddings with registered data. Upon recognition, the system logs the individualâ€™s attendance. This project leverages deep learning techniques to provide a scalable and user-friendly solution for automated attendance management.

Key Features:

Utilized the pre-trained VGGFace model for high-dimensional facial embeddings.
Real-time face detection and recognition.
Automatic attendance logging for recognized individuals.
